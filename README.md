<br>
This program will calculate the position and velocity of a falling object until it reaches 500 feet above ground.FallingObject java classThis class is used to instaniate a falling object and give instance methods to the object such as calculatePosition, to determine where the object currently is. Also has getter methods for the Time of the object and the Position of the Object.-Method to get current time.-Method to get current position-Method to increment the current time by 1 and Calculate and set the current velocity of the object at the updated current time. Calculate and set the current position of the object at the updated current time.-Method to display the current time, current position, and current velocity of the object.ObjectTracker java classThis class provides the main terminal output and input for the application. It calls the FallingObject class and instaniates a instance of that class and then uses its instance methods to perform calculations on a object as it falls.- method to read and validate the initial velocity of the object.-method to read and validate the initial position of the object from the user.- method that prompts the user for initial data and prints our results
